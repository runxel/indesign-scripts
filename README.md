> JavaScript scripts for Adobe InDesign CS6/CC. 

### [Apply Paragraph Style On Every Footnote](https://github.com/runxel/indesign-scripts/blob/master/ApplyParStyleOnEveryFootnote.jsx)
Applies the style of the currently selected footnote to all other footnotes.

### [Bundschatten](https://github.com/runxel/indesign-scripts/blob/master/Bundschatten.jsx)
Places a grey gradient in the centerfold/between two pages and thus simulates the shadow in an opened book.

### [Shine Thru](https://github.com/runxel/indesign-scripts/blob/master/Durchscheinen.jsx)
Simulates the translucency of paper by placing page elements onto the next/previous page with low opacity.

### [Zoom To Real 100%](https://github.com/runxel/indesign-scripts/blob/master/zoomToReal100.jsx)
Often enough the "100%" zoom does not match real world sizes. This script fixes this. You'll need to put in your own specific value. Best is to bind the script to a keyboard shortcut for easy use.
